The word “*IZWI*” means the “Voice” in Isizulu. Your voice matters in our core business function.

Our main focus is in two key areas:
* **HEALTH SECTOR** 

    * Consultations, 
    * Client staff solutions, 
    * Events management/co-ordinations,
    * Training for any health related needs in the corporate, private, educational and public sector.

<br>

* **LEGAL SECTOR** 

    * Providing legal advisory/consultations 
    * Referrals for litigation purposes in

        * Labour Law, 
        * Human Rights Law and 
        * Medical Legal Litigation.

Izwi GenHealth understands that our health sector/ Institutions (hospitals, clinics, mental health institutions and old age facilities) have become grossly overwhelmed with the number of patients needing medical or surgical interventions.

We further understand that the corporate sector has also become increasingly invested in their employees’ total wellness for improved productivity output.
We also note that the educational sector has also been drawn into caring more for their students’ physical and psychological wellbeing.
At Izwi GenHealth we therefore aim to assist these institutions to decrease this burden through the provision of preventative care.
We achieve this through providing holistic care to the client which encompasses all aspects of the physical, mental, psychological and spiritual wellbeing of the client.

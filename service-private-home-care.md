* **COMFORTING HANDS** - 
This is a basic non- medical service provided for your loved one in the comfort and privacy of their own home. At times we are so overwhelmed in our day to day activities that we are forced to send our loved ones to aged care facilities just for basic personal care and companionship. Our home care giver will provide a comforting and supportive presence throughout the day. They will assist your loved ones with their basic activities of daily living. This emotional/companionship support not only assists the client but also provides the family with peace of mind.

* **HEALING ARMS** - Should your loved one require more advanced medical nursing care (vital data observations, medication dispensing, wound dressings) then this would be assessed, and a specific nursing care plan is drawn up and a more qualified nursing staff member would be allocated to care for your loved one i.e: Enrolled Nurse (EN) or Registered Nurse (RN).

* **ANGEL HANDS** - This is for post hospital discharge care. A qualified care manager pays the client a visit at the hospital before discharge, an assessment is done, discussion with doctors for private home care. With the input of the family we discuss a care plan for specific individualised care needs. An appropriate category of nurse is allocated for client care.

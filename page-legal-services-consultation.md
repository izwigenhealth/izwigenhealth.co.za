Izwi GenHealth cares about your mental and psychological health.

We hear you when you feel that you have been unfairly treated in any sphere of your personal life. When one is in this vulnerable position, you just need a little guidance with the legal process.

We provide the basic initial consultation where we discuss your case, assess the merits of 	your case. We send out the first letter of demand at a minimal consultation fee. Should you require that your case proceed with litigation, we thereafter source the specialist attorneys and advocates for the representation of your case.

We also assist law institutions to source specialists that will conduct client assessments, site inspections and write reports for all your litigation cases.
